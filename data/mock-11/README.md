# mock-11

A mock community composed of 11 fungal strains plus human DNA, represented in equal abundances in a single sample. This was generated by the Broad Institute in 2011, and the sequencing data was contributed by Dr. Laura Parfrey at University of Colorado, Boulder, in 2012.

Previously called dataset-4 in [Bokulich et al. 2013](https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nmeth.2276).

# Known Issues / Notes

Note:
These barcode reads contain golay barcodes, and the mapping barcodes need to be reverse-complemented to match the reads. Run in qiime-1 using the following command:
``split_libraries_fastq.py -i mock-forward-read.fastq.gz -o split_libraries -m sample-metadata.tsv -b mock-index-read.fastq.gz --rev_comp_mapping_barcodes``

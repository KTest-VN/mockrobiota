# mock-6

A mock community composed of 67 bacteria represented in equal abundances in three replicate samples. These are the same community members present in [mock-7](../mock-7/) and [mock-8](../mock-8/), which consist of the same mock community samples analyzed on different Illumina sequencing runs. The mock community samples were generated by Dr. Peter Turnbaugh at Harvard in 2010, and sequenced by Illumina, Inc. in San Diego, CA, in 2010.

Previously called dataset-1 in [Bokulich et al. 2013](https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nmeth.2276) and dataset B6 in [Bokulich et al. 2015](https://dx.doi.org/10.7287/peerj.preprints.934v2).

# Known Issues / Notes

These barcode reads contain golay barcodes, and the mapping barcodes need to be reverse-complemented to match the reads. Run in qiime-1 using the following command:
``split_libraries_fastq.py -i mock-forward-read.fastq.gz -o split_libraries -m sample-metadata.tsv -b mock-index-read.fastq.gz --rev_comp_mapping_barcodes``

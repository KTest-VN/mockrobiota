# mock-12

Composed of 27 bacterial strains amplified with 515f/806r primers. Intended to include more closely related taxa than the other mock communities, the members of which were chosen in part for their well-separated 16S rRNA gene sequences. These strains are all distinguishable over the sequenced region of the 16S rRNA gene, but some pairs of strains differ by as little as one nucleotide. Generated by Benjamin Callahan at Stanford University in 2015.

Known as "Extreme" dataset in the original publication, doi:10.1038/nmeth.3869.

# Known Issues / Notes
